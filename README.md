### `NOTES` ###

#### **(●1)** ####
* UID is used to determine your own database. Think of it as an *account* that I use to identify which database belongs to who. You can generate your own UID in **https://www.uuidgenerator.net/**
* Once you generate a UID, please inform/contact me so I could add you as a registered user in the database
* **Unfortunately, this is all manual operation since I do not want to risk any of your personal information if I will add another form of *login* to remove this step (e.g. google account login). Sorry for the inconvenience.**

#### **(●2)** ####
* OAuth is the *authorization token* which refers to the bot/chatter which sends the messages in your chat
* This can be your own Twitch OAuth or if you have your own bot, you can enter the detail here. Make sure that the bot you will use, at the very least, can chat in your channel (or mod the bot if you are unsure of the permissions set)
* If you do not know your own OAuth, you can generate it using twitch provided app in **https://twitchapps.com/tmi/**

#### **(●3)** ####
* Dropstime parameter is in **milliseconds** (e.g. 100000 parameter = 100 seconds)

```
Sample Browser Source URL

*********************************************************************
http://xivalex.github.io/genshin_gacha?&channel=<channel_name>&uid=<UID>&oauth=<OAuth>&sr=50&c=90&three=100&four=200&five=300&cost=10&pity=50&drops=500&dropstime=120000&speed=3
*********************************************************************

By using the sample URL, it sets the program to have:
  - Winning a 5★ against a 4★ has a 50% chance
  - Winning a 3★ against a 4★ has a 90% chance
  - The Prize for 3★ is 100
  - The Prize for 4★ is 200
  - The Prize for 5★ is 300
  - The Cost on using the command is only 10
  - The Pity for a guaranteed 5★ is 50
  - The Drops Amount is 500 Primogems
  - The Drops Interval is 120 Seconds
  - The Playback speed of the videos are changed to 3x speed
```

3. Test the program by typing `!wstats` in your chat. It should initially display as 0 value for both **Primogems** and **Pity**. If command did not respond, check the following possible causes:
* Generated UID is not yet *registered* in the database. Contact me through stream/discord so I can add your UID
* OAuth used is invalid or expired. Try to re-generate the OAuth by visiting **https://twitchapps.com/tmi/**
* Re-check URL parameters, there may be an incorrect format in the link

## Features ##

### Wish Simulator ###
- Simulates `Genshin Impact` Wishes in the stream
- Wish can be trigerred by `!wish` or `!w` and inputting a value of 1 ~ 10 only
- When doing a 10-pull, a 4★ or above item is guaranteed regardless of pity

![single_wish](https://i.imgur.com/VYxjKmx.png)

![multi_wish](https://i.imgur.com/vMhdwez.png)

### Queue ###
- Only **one wish session at a time** is displayed on stream. A queue is implemented so that when multiple viewers type `!wish or !w` in chat, they will be placed in a queue (first-in, first-out) while waiting for the current wish on-stream to finish

![queue_sample](https://i.imgur.com/L365wwu.png)

### Database ###
- User information such as owned characters/weapons, pity, and primogems are saved in a database.
- Information is saved to the database **every minute**, if there will be any connection issues during this minute, wishes are not saved

### Pity System ###
- Pity is the number of times the user has wished
- The default value is 30 and if a user has wished for atleast 30 times without any 5★, the next wish will be a guaranteed 5★

### Primogem Drop ###
- The *currency* used by the gacha is `Primogems`
- `Primogems` can be earned by the viewers through this system or when `!wadd` command is used by streamer or moderators
